# Simple-PHP-Twitter-to-Mastodon-Timeline

Simple-PHP-Twitter-to-Mastodon-Timeline is a PHP script you can use to regularly post your twitter home timeline or user timeline to a Mastodon account. I wrote it because Twitter limits it's API for third party client and because Mastodon clients like Fedilab are getting better and better. I mainly use it to read later my twitter timeline without being annoyed anymore by a maximum of 200 tweets in one request or timeline position since Mastodon client dont have such limitations.
